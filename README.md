Systematic Mixed Methods Research for Social Scientists Annex of Practical Techniques

This annex is for readers of my volume published by Palgrave:
Olsen, W.K. (2022), Systematic Mixed-Methods Research for Social Scientists. London:  Palgrave.
URL https://link.springer.com/book/9783030931490

To cite this annex, use the Creative Commons method.  
Olsen, Wendy (2022), Systematic Mixed-Methods Research for Social Scientists Annex of Practical Techniques, Manchester, UK, Creative Commons, URL https://github.com/WendyOlsen/SystematicMixedMethods
I would like to reinforce how important it is that you cite the annex or the book or both. Using citations and footnotes helps your readers to trace where the exact methods were obtained.  Since this annex has chunks of code in software-specific styles, users may also gain a sense of the pseudo-code (programming logic), and must cite the source. 

Thank you!
